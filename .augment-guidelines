# Guidelines

- Always run `make clean` before building
- Use `npm run sass` to compile sass
- Use `make build` to build the go binary
- The `main.go` is located at `cmd/flutter-manager/main.go`
- Use `dawgs_test` for testing the fdawg commands
- Use port `3030` to serve the project as in `fdawg serve --port 3030`
